/* 
  A note on the following #define, though it's more of a rant. I
  understand the need for more secure versions of some of the C
  Standard Library functions which are notoriously problematic when
  used incorrectly, like strcpy() and scanf() and others. But
  declaring all such functions as DEPRECATED is the domain of the
  Standards Committee, not the implementation, period. The compiler
  SHOULD NOT spew out thousands of deprecation warnings for properly
  used Standard Library functions!!! It is understandable to offer
  more secure versions such as printf_s() and scanf_s(), but to
  declare the Standard Library functions as _DEPRECATED_ is non-
  conformant, nonstandard, and nonsensical; but this is exactly what
  Microsoft has done. The following is needed to disable all those 
  idiotic warnings, and since this  behavior will likely continue in
  future versions, it is set for all versions of the Microsoft 
  compiler.
