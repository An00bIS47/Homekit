# Installation

## Installation for IP based accessories

Simply use **pip3** to install the package:

```bash
pip3 install --user homekit[IP]
```

This installation only for IP based accessories can be done without any operating system level installations and should 
also work on operating systems other than linux (Mac OS X, Windows, ...).  

## Installation for Bluetooth LE based accessories

This variant requires some packages on operating systems for the access onto Bluetooth LE via dbus. These can be 
installed on Debian based operating systems via:

```bash
apt install -y libgirepository1.0-dev gcc libcairo2-dev pkg-config python3-dev gir1.2-gtk-3.0 libdbus-1-dev
```

After that, using **pip3** is sufficient again:

```bash
pip3 install --user homekit[BLE]
```

## Installation for both type of accessories

In this case, install the packages for your operating system and afterwards use **pip3**:

```bash
pip3 install --user homekit[IP,BLE]
```

# HomeKit Accessory
This package helps in creating a custom HomeKit Accessory.

The demonstration uses this JSON in `~/.homekit/demoserver.json`: 
```json
{
  "name": "DemoAccessory",
  "host_ip": "$YOUR IP",
  "host_port": 8080,
  "accessory_pairing_id": "12:00:00:00:00:00",
  "accessory_pin": "031-45-154",
  "peers": {},
  "unsuccessful_tries": 0,
  "c#": 0,
  "category": "Lightbulb"

}
```

Now let's spawn a simple light bulb accessory as demonstration:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os.path

from homekit import HomeKitServer
from homekit.model import Accessory, LightBulbService


if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        httpd = HomeKitServer(os.path.expanduser('~/.homekit/demoserver.json'))

        accessory = Accessory('Licht')
        lightService = LightBulbService()
        accessory.services.append(lightService)
        httpd.accessories.add_accessory(accessory)

        httpd.publish_device()
        print('published device and start serving')
        httpd.serve_forever()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print('unpublish device')
        httpd.unpublish_device()
```

If everything went properly, you should be able to add this accessory to your home on your iOS device.

# HomeKit Controller

```

The option `-f` specifies the file that contains the pairing data.

The option `-a` specifies the alias for the device.

The option `-c` specifies the characteristics to change. The format is `<aid>.<cid> <value>`. This option can be 
repeated to change multiple characteristics with one call  (e.g. `-c 1.9 On -c 1.8 22.3`) . 
 
The option `--adapter` specifies which Bluetooth device to use. This is optional and `hci0` is the default and is only 
used if the paired device is using Bluetooth LE.
 
The option `--log` specifies the log level for the command. This is optional. Use `DEBUG` to get more output.

For example, this command turns of a Koogeek P1EU Plug:
```
python3 -m homekit.put_characteristic -f koogeek.json -a koogeek -c 1.8 false
```

No output is given on successful operation or a error message is displayed.

## `get_events`

**!!Not yet implemented for Bluetooth LE Accessories!!**

This tool will register with an accessory and listen to the events send back from it.

Usage
```bash
python3 -m homekit.get_events -f ${PAIRINGDATAFILE} -a ${ALIAS} -c ${Characteristics} \
                             [--adapter ${ADAPTER}] [--log ${LOGLEVEL}]
```

The option `-f` specifies the file that contains the pairing data.

The option `-a` specifies the alias for the device.

The option `-c` specifies the characteristics to change. The format is `<aid>.<cid>`. This 
option can be repeated to listen to multiple characteristics with one call.

The option `--adapter` specifies which Bluetooth device to use. This is optional and `hci0` is the default and is 
only used if the paired device is using Bluetooth LE.
 
The option `--log` specifies the log level for the command. This is optional. Use `DEBUG` to get more output.

For example, you can listen to characteristics 1.8 (on characteristic), 1.22 (1 REALTIME_ENERGY) and 
1.23 (2 CURRENT_HOUR_DATA) of the Koogeek P1EU Plug with:
```bash
python3 -m homekit.get_events -f koogeek.json -a koogeek -c 1.8 -c 1.22 -c 1.23
```
This results in
```
event for 1.8: True
event for 1.22: 6.0
event for 1.23: 0.01666
event for 1.22: 17.0
event for 1.23: 0.06388
event for 1.23: 0.11111
event for 1.22: 18.0
event for 1.23: 0.16111
event for 1.8: False
```
